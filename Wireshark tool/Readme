Your browser should display the rather lengthy US Bill of Rights.
•	Stop Wireshark packet capture, and enter “http” in the display-filter-specification window,
    so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed. 
•	(Note:  If you are unable to run Wireshark on a live network connection, you can use the http-ethereal-trace-3 packet trace to answer the questions below; see footnote 1. This trace file was gathered while performing the steps above on one of the author’s computers.)
